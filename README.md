# Cheso - A scala chess library

## Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL, `sbt test` to run tests. You can also make sbt watch file changes and rerun each time using `~` (`sbt ~run`, `sbt ~test`).

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).

## Features
